notsosecret
=========

notsosecret is an aggregator of secret.ly links posted to Twitter.

You can view a live version of this at http://holle.red (at some point when DNS updates).

Why?
----
I think it's interesting to watch just how "secret" secrets aren't. Also I needed to learn Django and this seemed like a fine excuse.


Requirements
----
  - python
  - virtualenv
  - postgresql
  - Twitter API keys
  - bit.ly API key


Installation
----

pip install requirements.txt

(There is more, but I'll fill that in later. Date time.)

notsosecret.py is meant to run as a scheduled task of some sort.

Version
