notsosecret
=========

notsosecret is an aggregator of secret.ly links posted to Twitter.

Note: This was written during my free time while I was employed at a place that wasn't keen on it being public. I don't work at that place anymore, so now it can be public, it all it's horribleness. It used to live at http://holle.red. It does not anymore. RIP Secret.

Why?
----
I think it's interesting to watch just how "secret" secrets aren't. Also I needed to learn Django and this seemed like a fine excuse.

----
  - python
  - virtualenv
  - postgresql
  - Twitter API keys
  - bit.ly API key

----

pip install requirements.txt

(There is more, but I'll fill that in later.)
